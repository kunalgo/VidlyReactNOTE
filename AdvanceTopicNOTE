react doesnot support the global installation of create react app package.
so we need to uninstall it and bring it using a tool called npx.

>> npm uninstall -g create-react-app
>> npx create-react-app react-advance
>> cd react-advance
>> npm start

we use high order component to reuse logic across components

in high order component, we create a new function. And pass this component as an argument to this function.
in this function we r going to return a new component that wraps our original components.
in that bigger component we are going to wrap all that common functionality.

5>>

BY CONVENTION, High order component name should be start with  "with____".
here in Higher order component's we are passing the state
and we are passing this state as a props to our movie component.

to implement a higher order component, we create a new function that takes existing component.
and return an new components.

here we can return an class component or functional component. all we are doing here is
we are implementing some logic and sharing that logic across different component.

6>>

till now we knew functional component are stateless and class component are stateful.
so if we want to use state or life cycle methods then we should must use class components.


from react 16.8 we have some new concept "hooks", which allow us to build functional component
with all the feature we have in class component.
so we can use state and life cycle methods of class component.

functional component makes our code shorter then functional component.

useEffect -> this function get call every time the function get rendered.
    optionally we can use array of dependency with it, so in this array we
    list all the state variable that are effect hook dependent upon.

    eg : if we add count to the array, this function will called when the count
    variable get changes.

    here we are using return function as componentDidMount.


10__

the function we passed to the effect hook has to be regular function.

Here we are going to learn how to use context-API in class component.

the provider component is nothing special.
It has a special value called, "value".
